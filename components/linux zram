You can enable zram on an AArch64 Ubuntu userland using the zram-tools package, which automates the setup and configuration process. This is the most straightforward method, as it properly sets up a compressed swap space in your RAM without manual scripting. 
Step 1: Install zram-tools
The zram-tools package provides a service that automatically configures zram on boot. 
Open your terminal and update your package list:
sh
sudo apt update

Install the package:
sh
sudo apt install zram-tools

Step 2: Configure zram
The default settings should work well for most systems, but you can customize them by editing the /etc/default/zramswap file. 
Open the configuration file with a text editor:
sh
sudo nano /etc/default/zramswap

Modify the settings as needed. The most common settings to change are ALGO (compression algorithm) and PERCENTAGE (size). For example:
ALGO: zstd generally provides a better compression ratio than lz4 with a good speed tradeoff, especially on modern CPUs.
PERCENTAGE: Sets the zram device size as a percentage of your total RAM. The default is 50%, but you can adjust it based on your needs.
sh
ENABLED=true
ALGO=zstd
PERCENTAGE=50

Save the file by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y, and then Enter. 
Step 3: Reboot and verify
For the changes to take effect, reboot your system. The zram-tools service will automatically set up the zram device at startup. 
Reboot your system:
sh
sudo reboot

After rebooting, open a terminal and run zramctl to check if zram is active.
sh
zramctl

You should see an output that lists a zram device (e.g., /dev/zram0), its size, and other details.
Alternatively, use cat /proc/swaps to confirm it is being used as a swap device.
sh
cat /proc/swaps

The output should show a zram device with a high priority. 
Disabling zram (if needed)
To disable zram, you can uninstall the zram-tools package: 
sh
sudo apt purge zram-tools

sudo reboot
