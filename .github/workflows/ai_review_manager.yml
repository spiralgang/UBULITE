# AI Review Manager Workflow Configuration
# Note: This workflow was using a non-existent action 'ai-review-manager@v4'
# Since this action doesn't exist on GitHub Actions marketplace, this workflow
# has been disabled. If you want to implement AI reviews, consider using:
# - GitHub's built-in code review features
# - Third-party review tools like CodeClimate, SonarCloud
# - Custom scripts with AI APIs

# Uncomment and modify below if you implement a working AI review system:
#
# name: AI Review Manager
#
# on:
#   push:
#     branches:
#       - main
#
# jobs:
#   review:
#     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#     steps:
#       - name: Checkout code
#         uses: actions/checkout@v4
#
#       - name: Placeholder for AI Review
#         run: echo "AI review functionality not implemented yet"
