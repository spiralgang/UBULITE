# UBULITE Development Tools

This directory is reserved for development tools, utilities, and helper scripts that aid in the development process.

## Purpose

The `tools/` directory will contain:

- **Build tools** - Custom build utilities and helpers
- **Development utilities** - Code generation, formatting, linting tools  
- **Testing helpers** - Test setup, mocking, and validation tools
- **Deployment tools** - Deployment automation and configuration
- **Maintenance scripts** - Repository maintenance and cleanup tools

## Guidelines

### Tool Development
- Create focused, single-purpose tools
- Include comprehensive help/usage information
- Follow consistent CLI patterns
- Make tools cross-platform when possible

### Organization  
- Group related tools in subdirectories
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Include tool documentation
- Maintain compatibility with project standards

### Contributing Tools

When adding new tools:

1. **Document purpose and usage clearly**
2. **Include examples and help text**
3. **Test on multiple platforms if possible**  
4. **Follow existing naming conventions**
5. **Update this README with tool descriptions**

## Future Expansion

This directory structure will grow as the project develops more sophisticated tooling needs. Check back for updates as new development tools are added.
